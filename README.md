## Description

This Project's goal is to showcase use of the Google Maps Api by
creating a Google Maps Activity, where the user starts at his own
location, then, by pressing on 'take me somewhere random', the
user will be taken somewhere random on earth, with within-app
customizable precision (default 10^4). If the user clicks on
'take me home' they will be redirected to their starting location.
Another task is for all the visited places to be recorded for the
lifecycle of the app with precision of an integer.
